# tymeshift's PHP code test ðŸ§ª

Hello,

Didn't work with CodeCeption before, so maybe it's not written in the best way.

Not sure I understood the `ScheduleItemInterface` part, maybe I got it wrong.

Also, I didn't pay too much attention to dates (date time), so in my case `Task` entity is working with integers.

Regards,
Aleksandar
